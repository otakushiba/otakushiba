# Hi, I’m Yiting 👋  
Product Designer from Taiwan 🇹🇼 · Based in Berlin 🌍
I’m currently open to new roles across Europe.  
Let’s connect: [Portfolio](https://yiting.space/) · [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)

I love learning by building. 
This GitHub is my **vibe coding playground** 🤓✨  

## My workflow
Idea → Figma → Prototype (Framer / Lovable / Claude / Cursor) → GitHub → Iterate

## Outside of work
Climbing, dancing, and acrobatics. 🧗💃
